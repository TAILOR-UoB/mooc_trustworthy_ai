This page shows a problem when showing a terminal in a code block that does not
allow the viewers to update their content in the subsequent code blocks.

```{shinylive-python}
#| components: [editor, terminal]

print('First code will prevent the rest of the code blocks from showing their rendered output')
```

```{shinylive-python}
#| standalone: true
#| components: [editor, viewer]
from shiny import App, ui

app_ui = ui.page_fluid("The text in the second code block is not shown.")

app = App(app_ui, None)
```

```{shinylive-python}
#| standalone: true
#| components: [editor, viewer]
from shiny import App, ui

app_ui = ui.page_fluid("The text in the third code block is not shown.")

app = App(app_ui, None)
```
