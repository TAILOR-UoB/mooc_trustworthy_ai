This page shows a problem when creating multiple shinylive directives each with
a terminal. The result is that each terminal has its own standard input,
however only the last terminal among all of them (the one at the bottom of the
page) shows the standard output for all of them.


```{shinylive-python}
#| components: [editor, terminal]

print('This is the first code.')
```

```{shinylive-python}
#| components: [editor, terminal]

print('This is the second code.')
```

```{shinylive-python}
#| components: [editor, terminal]

print('This is the last code.')
```
