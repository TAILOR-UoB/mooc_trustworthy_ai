# Foundations of Trustworthy AI {.unnumbered}

::: {.callout-note icon="true" collapse="false"}
This website is authored in `Quarto`. See [New Ways of Publishing: A Roadmap to Authoring Online Training Material](https://tailor-uob.github.io/new_ways_of_publishing/) for a detailed description of how this training material was created and the formats and tools used. 
:::

This website contains two short courses related to Trustworthy AI. 
The content can be viewed in a variety of ways, following the Single Input, Multiple Output paradigm. 
See the links under `Other Formats` in the right-hand panel. 

- [Introduction to Optimal Decision Making](https://tailor-uob.github.io/mooc_trustworthy_ai/cha_odm/odm.html) was created from scratch in `Quarto`, as described [here](https://tailor-uob.github.io/new_ways_of_publishing/use-cases/qmd.html). 
- [Classifier Calibration](https://tailor-uob.github.io/mooc_trustworthy_ai/cha_wahcc/wahcc.html) was converted to `Quarto` from LaTeX Beamer source, as described [here](https://tailor-uob.github.io/new_ways_of_publishing/use-cases/tex-to-qmd.html). Note that this is a much more involved process, and some imperfections remain.
