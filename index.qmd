# Foundations of Trustworthy AI {.unnumbered}

This website is a demonstrator for authoring online training material in `Quarto`. 
See the companion website [New Ways of Publishing: A Roadmap to Authoring Online Training Material](https://tailor-uob.github.io/new_ways_of_publishing/) for a detailed description of how this training material was created and the formats and tools used.

At the moment we offer the following two short courses related to Trustworthy AI as demonstrators: 

- [Introduction to Optimal Decision Making](./cha_odm/odm.html) was created from scratch in `Quarto`, as described [here](https://tailor-uob.github.io/new_ways_of_publishing/use-cases/qmd.html). 
- [Classifier Calibration](./cha_wahcc/wahcc.html) was converted to `Quarto` from LaTeX Beamer source, as described [here](https://tailor-uob.github.io/new_ways_of_publishing/use-cases/tex-to-qmd.html). Note that this is a much more involved process, and some imperfections remain. 

The content can be viewed in a variety of ways, following the [Single-In-Multiple-Out](https://tailor-uob.github.io/new_ways_of_publishing/introduction/publishing-workflow.html#single-in-multiple-out) paradigm. 
See the links under `Other Formats` in the right-hand panel.
