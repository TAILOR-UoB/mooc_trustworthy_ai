# Foundations of Trustworthy AI {.unnumbered}

This website serves as an example of the possible online content for a Massive
Open Online Course aligned with the TAILOR PhD curriculum in Trustworthy AI.

The material in this course equips students with essential knowledge and skills
for developing trustworthy Artificial Intelligence systems. With a general
foundation on Artificial Intelligence, students learn how an integrated
approach to learning, optimisation and reasoning can achieve trustworthiness.
The first three topics are introductory, with (0) a general overview of
Artificial Intelligence that ensures a common understanding across the
curriculum; (1) a special focus on the trustworthy aspects of AI; and (2) how
to leverage complementary AI paradigms and representations. The last three
advanced topics include (3) AI agents deciding and learning how to act; (4) AI
agents acting and learning in society; and (5) ensuring that AI tools and
systems are performant, robust and trustworthy.
