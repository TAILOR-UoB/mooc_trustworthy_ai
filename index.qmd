## About {.unnumbered}

This MOOC is based on the first topic proposed in the TAILOR PhD curriculum
about Integrating Approaches for Trustworthy AI. The idea is to adapt the
content of The TAILOR Handbook of Trustworthy AI and create a course with six
subtopics

1. Explainable AI Systems
2. Safety and Robustness
3. Fairness, Equity, and Justice by Design
4. Accountability and Reproducibility
5. Respect for Privacy
6. Sustainability
