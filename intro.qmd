title: WebR in Quarto HTML Documents
format: html

# Introduction

I have removed the following lines from the header

%engine: knitr
%filters:
%  - webr

This is a webr-enabled code cell in a Quarto HTML document.

I changed `{webr-r}` for ` ` while a problem is fixed.

```
fit = lm(mpg ~ am, data = mtcars)
summary(fit)
```
