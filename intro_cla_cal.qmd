Taking inspiration from forecasting
-----------------------------------

Weather forecasters started thinking about calibration a long time ago
[@brier1950]. 
- A forecast `70\% chance of rain' should be followed by rain 70\% of the
time.
This is immediately applicable to binary classification: 
- A prediction `70\% chance of spam' should be spam 70\% of the time.
and to multi-class classification: 
- A prediction `70\% chance of setosa, 10\% chance of versicolor and 20\%
chance of virginica' should be setosa/versicolor/virginica 70/10/20\% of the
time.
In general: 
- A predicted probability (vector) should match empirical (observed)
probabilities.

Q: What does `$x\%$ of the time' mean?
