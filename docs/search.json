The expected cost of predicting class \\(j\\) for instance \\(x\\) is\n\\[\nC(\\hat{Y}=j|X=x) = \\sum_i P(Y=i|X=x)C(\\hat{Y}=j|Y=i)\n\\]\nwhere \\(P(Y=i|X=x)\\) is the probability of instance \\(x\\) having true class \\(i\\) (as would be given by the Bayes-optimal classifier).\nThe optimal decision is then to predict the class with lowest expected cost:\n\\[\n\\hat{Y}^* = \\mathop{\\mathrm{argmin}}_j C(\\hat{Y}=j|X=x) = \\mathop{\\mathrm{argmin}}_j \\sum_i P(Y=i|X=x)C(\\hat{Y}=j|Y=i)\n\\]\nIn binary classification we have:\n\\[\\begin{align*}\nC(\\hat{Y}=+|X=x) &= P(+|x)C(+|+) + \\big(1-P(+|x)\\big)C(+|-) \\\\\nC(\\hat{Y}=-|X=x) &= P(+|x)C(-|+) + \\big(1-P(+|x)\\big)C(-|-)\n\\end{align*}\\]\nOn the optimal decision boundary these two expected costs are equal, which gives\n\\[\\begin{align*}%\\label{eq::cost-threshold}\nP(+|x)  = \\frac{\\textcolor{blue}{C(+|-)-C(-|-)}}{\\textcolor{blue}{C(+|-)-C(-|-)}+\\textcolor{red}{C(-|+)-C(+|+)}} \\triangleq c\n\\end{align*}\\]\nThis gives the optimal threshold on the hypothetical Bayes-optimal probabilities.\nIt is also the best thing to do in practice – as long as the probabilities are well-calibrated!\nWithout loss of generality we can set the cost of true positives and true negatives to zero; \\(c = \\frac{c_{\\text{FP}}}{c_{\\text{FP}} + c_{\\text{FN}}}\\) is then the cost of a false positive in proportion to the combined cost of one false positive and one false negative.\n\nE.g., if false positives are 4 times as costly as false negatives then we set the decision threshold to \\(4/(4+1)=0.8\\) in order to only make positive predictions if we’re pretty certain.\n\nSimilar reasoning applies to changes in class priors:\n\nif we trained on balanced classes but want to deploy with 4 times as many positives compared to negatives, we lower the decision threshold to \\(0.2\\);\nmore generally, if we trained for class ratio \\(r\\) and deploy for class ratio \\(r'\\) we set the decision threshold to \\(r/(r+r')\\).\n\nCost and class prior changes can be combined in the obvious way."

    "section": "5.5 Calibrating multi-class classifiers",
    "text": "5.5 Calibrating multi-class classifiers\n\n5.5.1 What’s so special about multi-class calibration?\nSimilar to classification, some methods are inherently multi-class but most are not.\nThis leads to (at least) three different ways of defining what it means to be fully multiclass-calibrated. - Many recent papers use the (weak) notion of confidence calibration.\nEvaluating multi-class calibration is in its full generality still an open problem.\n\n\n5.5.2 Definitions of calibration for more than two classes\nThe following definitions of calibration are equivalent for binary classification but increasingly stronger for more than two classes:\n\nConfidence calibration: only consider the highest predicted probability.\nClass-wise calibration: only consider marginal probabilities.\nMulti-class calibration: consider the entire vector of predicted probabilities.\n\n\n\n5.5.3 Confidence calibration\nThis was proposed by Guo et al. (2017), requiring that among all instances where the probability of the most likely class is predicted to be \\(c\\), the expected accuracy is \\(c\\). (We call this `confidence calibration’ to distinguish it from the stronger notions of calibration.)\nFormally, a probabilistic classifier \\(\\hat{\\mathbf{p}}:\\mathcal{X}\\to\\Delta_{k}\\) is confidence-calibrated, if for any confidence level \\(c\\in[0,1]\\), the actual proportion of the predicted class, among all possible instances \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) being predicted this class with confidence \\(c\\), is equal to \\(c\\):\n\\[\\begin{align*}\nP(Y=i \\: | \\: \\hat{p}_i(\\mathbf{x})=c)=c\\qquad\\text{where }\\ i=\\mathop{\\mathrm{argmax}}_j \\hat{p}_j(\\mathbf{x}).\n%P\\Big(Y=\\argmax\\big(\\vph(X)\\big) \\: \\Big| \\: \\max\\big(\\vph(X)\\big)=c\\Big)=c.\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\n5.5.4 Class-wise calibration}{\nOriginally proposed by Zadrozny and Elkan (2002), this requires that all one-vs-rest probability estimators obtained from the original multiclass model are calibrated.\nFormally, a probabilistic classifier \\(\\hat{\\mathbf{p}}:\\mathcal{X}\\to\\Delta_{k}\\) is classwise-calibrated, if for any class \\(i\\) and any predicted probability \\(q_i\\) for this class, the actual proportion of class \\(i\\), among all possible instances \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) getting the same prediction \\(\\hat{p}_i(\\mathbf{x})=q_i\\), is equal to \\(q_i\\):\n\\[\\begin{align*}\nP(Y=i\\mid \\hat{p}_i(\\mathbf{x})=q_i)=q_i\\qquad\\text{for }\\ i=1,\\dots,k.\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\n5.5.5 Multi-class calibration\nThis is the strongest form of calibration for multiple classes, subsuming the previous two definitions.\nA probabilistic classifier \\(\\hat{\\mathbf{p}}:\\mathcal{X}\\to\\Delta_{k}\\) is multiclass-calibrated if for any prediction vector \\(\\mathbf{q}=(q_1,\\dots,q_k)\\in\\Delta_{k}\\), the proportions of classes among all possible instances \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) getting the same prediction \\(\\hat{\\mathbf{p}}(\\mathbf{x})=\\mathbf{q}\\) are equal to the prediction vector \\(\\mathbf{q}\\):\n\\[\\begin{align*} %\\label{eq:calib}\nP(Y=i\\mid \\hat{\\mathbf{p}}(\\mathbf{x})=\\mathbf{q})=q_i\\qquad\\text{for }\\ i=1,\\dots,k.\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\n5.5.6 Reminder: binning needed\nFor practical purposes, the conditions in these definitions need to be relaxed. This is where binning comes in.\nOnce we have the bins, we can draw a reliability diagram as in the two-class case. For class-wise calibration, we can show per-class reliability diagrams or a single averaged one.\nThe degree of calibration is assessed using the gaps in the reliability diagram. All of this will be elaborated in the next part of the tutorial.\n\n\n5.5.7 Important points to remember\n\nOnly well-calibrated probability estimates are worthy to be called probabilities: otherwise they are just scores that happen to be in the \\([0,1]\\) range.\nBinning will be required in some form: instance-based probability evaluation metrics such as Brier score or log-loss always measure calibration plus something else.\nIn multi-class settings, think carefully about which form of calibration you need: e.g., confidence-calibration is too weak in a cost-sensitive setting."
