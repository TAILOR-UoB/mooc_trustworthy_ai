@inproceedings{deirdre2008,
   abstract = {For two-class classification, it is common to classify by setting a threshold on class probability estimates, where the threshold is determined by ROC curve analysis. An analog for multi-class classification is learning a new class partitioning of the multiclass probability simplex to minimize empirical misclassification costs. We analyze the interplay between systematic errors in the class probability estimates and cost matrices for multiclass classification. We explore the effect on the class partitioning of five different transformations of the cost matrix. Experiments on benchmark datasets with naive Bayes and quadratic discriminant analysis show the effectiveness of learning a new partition matrix compared to previously proposed methods.},

@inproceedings{zadrozny2001,
   abstract = {Accurate, well-calibrated estimates of class membership probabilities are needed in many supervised learning applications, in particular when a cost-sensitive decision must be made about examples with example-dependent costs. This paper presents simple but successful meth- ods for obtaining calibrated probability estimates from decision tree and naive Bayesian classi- fiers. Using the large and challenging KDD’98 contest dataset as a testbed, we report the re- sults of a detailed experimental comparison of ten methods, according to four evaluation mea- sures. We conclude that binning succeeds in significantly improving naive Bayesian probabil- ity estimates, while for improving decision tree probability estimates, we recommend smoothing by that we call curtailment. ? -estimation and a new variant of pruning},
