**The current version only prints out on the last terminal (end of the page),
while the rest of the terminals seems to be used only as a standard input.**

```{shinylive-python}
#| components: [editor, terminal]

print('Hello world!')
```

```{shinylive-python}
#| components: [editor, terminal]

l1 = list() 
l2 = []

print(l1)
print(l2)
```

```{shinylive-python}
#| components: [editor, terminal]

print(len(l1))
print(len(l2))
```

```{shinylive-python}
#| components: [editor, terminal]

l3 = [1, 2, 3]
print(l3)
print(len(l3))
```


```{shinylive-python}
#| components: [editor, terminal]

l1.append(1)
print(l1)
l1.append(10)
print(l1)
```
```{shinylive-python}
#| components: [editor, terminal]

l2.append(100)
print(l2)
```
Note that the `+` operator does not modify the lists inplace, rather it
constructs a new list from the values of `l1` and `l2`.

If inplace extension is required, the `.extend` member function should be used:

```{shinylive-python}
#| components: [editor, terminal]

print(l1)
print(l2)
print(l1 + l2)
```

```{shinylive-python}
#| components: [editor, terminal]

l1.extend(l2)
print(l1)
print(l2)
```

Items can be removed from the lists too, with the `pop` function. When called,
the pop function removes the last element of the list. If an argument is passed
into the `pop` function, the element contained at that position in the list is
removed, e.g.

```{shinylive-python}
#| components: [editor, terminal]

l2 = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

l2.pop(1)
print(l2)

l2.pop()
print(l2)
```


```{shinylive-python}
#| components: [editor, terminal]

print(l1)
```
